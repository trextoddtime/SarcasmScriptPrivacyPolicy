# SarcasmScriptPrivacyPolicy
Privacy Policy of the Android application Sarcasm Script (the app)

The app is very simple. The app was made for offline use. There is no telemetry attached by the developer.

Sarcasm Script attempts to not store user data anywhere beyond the app container itself (so you can return and do your thing). 

Sarcasm Script will only store the last thing you typed in since the app has opened. If you close the app, you will need to re-type in what was once there.

Sarcasm Script app itself will NOT send any data back to the developer.

Sarcasm Script's interface is meant to be easy to use and a fluid interface. When you tap on either result, it will be copied to your clip board which, depending on the user's phone/region, has its own policy, check your manufacturer and local laws.
